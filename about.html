<h2>About</h2>

<p>I studied Electronic Information Engineering in college, and it did not make a great first impression on me. Those four years were dedicated to lectures that would feed me with knowledge, assignments that would train me on getting the correct answers, and exams that would prove I had memorised everything I should. </p>

<p>After graduating from college, I went to study Product Design, hoping to become the designer I had always thought I wanted to be. I was so ready to leave science and engineering all behind me, but ended up falling in love with the way they were taught in the design program, and how they were deeply intertwined with art and design. I had a lot of fun building and breaking things and, more importantly, putting my prototypes in people's hands and seeing their faces light up with excitement. </p>

<p>It now seems to me that science and engineering are actually really cool. I wonder how our education can do them justice, and if there is something I can do to help.</p>
