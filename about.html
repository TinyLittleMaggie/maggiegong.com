<h2>About</h2>

<p>I have a confession to make. I went to college to study Electronic Information Engineering mainly because my father wanted me to. Four years of my life were dedicated to lectures that would fill me with knowledge, assignments that would train me on getting the correct answers, and exams that would prove I had memorised everything I should. It was not a great experience.</p>

<p>After graduating college, I went to study Product Design, hoping to become the designer I had always thought I wanted to be. I was so ready to leave science and engineering all behind me, but I ended up falling in love with the way they were taught in the design program, and how they were deeply intertwined with art and design. I had a lot of fun building and breaking things and, more importantly, putting my prototypes in people's hands and seeing their faces light up with excitement. </p>

<p>It now seems to me that science and engineering are actually really cool. I wonder how our education can do them justice, and if there is something I can do to help.</p>
