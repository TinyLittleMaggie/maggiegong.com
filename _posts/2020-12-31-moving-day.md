I have spent the past 1.5 months doing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marie_Kondo#KonMari_method" target="_blank">KonMari</a> for all my content that I used to host on Adobe Portfolio. As of today, I am officially moving to this new website that I built in <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/" target="_blank">Jekyll</a>!

### How I plan to organise my content

#### Home

This is where I showcase my favourite projects.

#### Blog

There will be three types of posts:

  - _**Projects**_ typically take a few weeks or sometimes a few months to complete. They are often directly related to my long-term goal.

  - _**Experiments**_ are smaller projects that take anywhere from an afternoon to a few days. _Experiments_ can be about anything: learning new skills, trying out new tools, or just goofing around.

  - Unlike _Projects_ and _Experiments_ where I write about things I have _done_, _**Thoughts**_ is a "miscellaneous" category where I can write about anything I want.

I have said "anything" twice already. I guess it is scary to commit to a long-term goal, so it takes two free-to-do-whatever categories to balance it out :)

#### About

Writing the _About_ page gave me an identity crisis, but yes, it describes why I am doing everything that I do. You will also find my contact information on this page.

### Thank you and goodbye

A lot of projects have been archived despite the fact that each one of them has helped me learn and grow as a human and as a professional.

Here's a group photo of some of my recent projects. Thank you all for being part of my journey!
